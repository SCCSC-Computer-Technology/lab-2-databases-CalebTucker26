Hey Caleb, your Form is very well made. I especially liked the dropdown menu you used for sorting the data.  I used buttons that would sort it instead.
One small thing I noticed is that the primary key (ID) appears to show an index of -1 when a new row is added. This doesn’t break the application or affect functionality,
but from a user perspective, it might be clearer if the indexing started at 1 instead.

One thing we did do similarly was that we mainly used SQL in the cityTableAdpater. 
However, maybe this is something on my end, when I press configure to see your SQL, some of the formatt is off. Some of your query are super spaced out with weirld indents. 
Agian, this doesn't interfered with your app, but it does make the code less legitable. 
Another minor thing would be to string mask the population total, shown by clicking the "Get Population" button, with the appropriate commas. For example, 100000 would be 100,000. 
But overall, great job!
